Some civil engineering projects that I assisted on the coding side.

## Bone Growth Algorithm
Part of a Bachelor's dissertation that looks into an optimisation algorithm that deduces the optimal cross-section shape of a beam. By modelling compression and tension on the material, the algorithm is able to produce an hourglass shaped cross-section, similar to the widely used I-Beam in modern contstructions. However due to time constraints, this algorithm was not able to fully emulate the initially hypothesesed shape.

## Viaduct Cost
Given a cross-sectional map of solid ground and ground levels, the algorithm can effectively calculate the optimal distance between each viaduct spans for the minimal cost.
